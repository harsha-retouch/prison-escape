# Helicopter Prison Escapes: Analysis

This analysis summarizes 50 documented helicopter-assisted prison escapes and attempts from 1971 to 2020, as listed in `prison.csv`.

## Overview

- **Total Incidents:** 50
- **Success Rate:** Approximately 60% succeeded; the rest were foiled or failed.
- **Geographic Spread:** Incidents occurred in 16 countries, most frequently in France, the United States, Canada, Belgium, and Greece.

## Patterns and Methods

- **Helicopter Acquisition:** Most helicopters were hijacked or rented under false pretenses (e.g., posing as tourists or officials).
- **Execution:** Accomplices often used weapons or threats to force pilots to land in prison yards or on roofs.
- **Escapees:** Included murderers, bank robbers, drug traffickers, political prisoners, and high-profile criminals.
- **Aftermath:** Many escapees were recaptured within days or weeks; some remained at large for years.

## Notable Cases

- **Pascal Payet (France):** Escaped three times by helicopter and organized escapes for others.
- **Vassilis Paleokostas & Alket Rizai (Greece):** Escaped twice from Korydallos Prison by helicopter.
- **John Killick (Australia):** Escaped with help from librarian Lucy Dudko, who hijacked a helicopter.

## Security Responses

- **Increased Security:** Many prisons installed cables, nets, or alarms to prevent helicopter landings after successful escapes.
- **Foiled Attempts:** Some escapes failed due to pilot resistance, mechanical issues, or timely police intervention.

## Weapons and Violence

- **Armed Accomplices:** Guns, grenades, and tear gas were used in several escapes.
- **Shootouts:** Some incidents involved exchanges of gunfire with guards or police.
- **Fatalities:** A few attempts resulted in deaths or injuries to pilots, accomplices, or escapees.

## Trends

- **France:** Most frequent location for helicopter escapes, especially in the 2000s.
- **Repeat Offenders:** Some criminals attempted or succeeded in escaping multiple times.
- **Media Attention:** Several escapes inspired books, films, and songs.

## Conclusion

Helicopter prison escapes are rare but dramatic events that often lead to changes in prison security and public fascination. The majority of escapees are eventually recaptured, but the ingenuity and boldness of these attempts continue to capture attention worldwide.
